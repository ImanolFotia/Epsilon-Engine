First off:

Thanks SO much for supporting FreePBR.com by purchasing the "4K Rocks Super Pack". :) FreePBR.com requires a huge amount of server bandwidth to run smoothly, and this will help with those costs. It will also allow me to put more time into providing free PBR texture sets. 


This package of 16 FBX rocks includes:

Rock1: 512 tris
Rock2: 768 tris
Rock3: 1040 tris
Rock4: 428 tris
Rock5: 768 tris
Rock6: 1690 tris
Rock7: 1092 tris
Rock8: 980 tris
Rock9: 1706 tris
Rock10: 1228 tris
Rock11: 384 tris
Rock12: 768 tris
Rock13: 464 tris
Rock14: 640 tris
Rock15: 1439 tris
Rock16: 1884 tris


Each FBX model comes with maps supporting a PBR workflow:

Albedo/Color PNG @ 4K
Roughness PNG @ 4K
Metalness PNG @ 4K
Smoothness in alpha of Metallic PSD @ 4K (Unity)
Normal Map for DirectX @ 4K
Normal Map for OpenGL @ 4K
Ambient Occlusion @ 4K


Please note that:

You can use these textures in your games, 3d projects, or what ever. This includes games and projects that you make money from. :) 

But.... This rock pack may not be redistributed. Please don't share, pirate, offer on your site, and so on. No file sharing please. 


Only have 8 rocks?:

If so, you are missing the other half of the download. There are 2 zip files you need to download. :)
