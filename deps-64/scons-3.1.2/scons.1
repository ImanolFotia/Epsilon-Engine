.SH "NAME"
scons \- a software construction tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBscons\fR\ 'u
\fBscons\fR [\fIoptions\fR...] [\fIname=val\fR...] [\fItargets\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBscons\fR
utility builds software (or other files) by determining which component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands to rebuild them\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
searches for a file named
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR,
\fIsconstruct\fR,
\fISConstruct\&.py\fR
\fISconstruct\&.py\fR
or
\fIsconstruct\&.py\fR
(in that order) in the current directory and reads its configuration from the first file found\&. An alternate file name may be specified via the
\fB\-f\fR
option\&.
.PP
The
\fISConstruct\fR
file can specify subsidiary configuration files using the
\fBSConscript\fR() function\&. By convention, these subsidiary files are named
\fISConscript\fR, although any name may be used\&. (Because of this naming convention, the term "SConscript files" is sometimes used to refer generically to all
\fBscons\fR
configuration files, regardless of actual file name\&.)
.PP
The configuration files specify the target files to be built, and (optionally) the rules to build those targets\&. Reasonable default rules exist for building common software components (executable programs, object files, libraries), so that for most software projects, only the target and input files need be specified\&.
.PP
Before reading the
\fISConstruct\fR
file,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a directory named
\fIsite_scons\fR
in various system directories (see below) and the directory containing the
\fISConstruct\fR
file; for each of those dirs which exists,
\fIsite_scons\fR
is prepended to sys\&.path, the file
\fIsite_scons/site_init\&.py\fR, is evaluated if it exists, and the directory
\fIsite_scons/site_tools\fR
is prepended to the default toolpath if it exists\&. See the
\fB\-\-no\-site\-dir\fR
and
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
options for more details\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts, so you may use normal Python scripting capabilities (such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries) to handle complicated build situations\&.
\fBscons\fR, however, reads and executes all of the SConscript files
\fIbefore\fR
it begins building any targets\&. To make this obvious,
\fBscons\fR
prints the following messages about what it is doing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons foo\&.out
scons: Reading SConscript files \&.\&.\&.
scons: done reading SConscript files\&.
scons: Building targets  \&.\&.\&.
cp foo\&.in foo\&.out
scons: done building targets\&.
$
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The status messages (everything except the line that reads "cp foo\&.in foo\&.out") may be suppressed using the
\fB\-Q\fR
option\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
does not automatically propagate the external environment used to execute
\fBscons\fR
to the commands used to build target files\&. This is so that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the time
\fBscons\fR
is invoked\&. This also means that if the compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target files are not in standard system locations,
\fBscons\fR
will not find them unless you explicitly set the
\fBPATH\fR
to include those locations\&. Whenever you create an
\fBscons\fR
construction environment, you can propagate the value of
\fBPATH\fR
from your external environment as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {\*(AqPATH\*(Aq : os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Similarly, if the commands use external environment variables like
\fBPATH\fR,
\fBHOME\fR,
\fBJAVA_HOME\fR,
\fBLANG\fR,
\fBSHELL\fR,
\fBTERM\fR, etc\&., these variables can also be explicitly propagated:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {\*(AqPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq],
                         \*(AqHOME\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqHOME\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user\*(Aqs complete external environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = os\&.environ)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user\*(Aqs environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for many configurations\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can scan known input files automatically for dependency information (for example, #include statements in C or C++ files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately whenever any "included" input file changes\&.
\fBscons\fR
supports the ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
knows how to fetch files automatically from SCCS or RCS subdirectories using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
is normally executed in a top\-level directory containing a
\fISConstruct\fR
file, optionally specifying as command\-line arguments the target file or files to be built\&.
.PP
By default, the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
will build all target files in or below the current directory\&. Explicit default targets (to be built when no targets are specified on the command line) may be defined in the SConscript file(s) using the
\fBDefault()\fR
function, described below\&.
.PP
Even when
\fBDefault()\fR
targets are specified in the SConscript file(s), all target files in or below the current directory may be built by explicitly specifying the current directory (\&.) as a command\-line target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Building all target files, including any files outside of the current directory, may be specified by supplying a command\-line target of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons /
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be built (on Windows systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons C:\e D:\e
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To build only specific targets, supply them as command\-line arguments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons foo bar
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
in which case only the specified targets will be built (along with any derived files on which they depend)\&.
.PP
Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is not usually necessary\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
flag removes all files necessary to build the specified target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-c \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove all target files, or:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-c build export
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove target files under build and export\&. Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
\fBClean()\fR
function\&. Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
invocation can be prevented from being removed by using the
\fBNoClean\fR() function\&.
.PP
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the top\-level directory (where the
\fISConstruct\fR
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to be built:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons src/subdir
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
\fB\-u\fR
option, which traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the
\fISConstruct\fR
file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
cd src/subdir
scons \-u \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBscons\fR
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
\fB\-j\fR
option that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-j 4
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
builds four targets in parallel, for example\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared between multiple builds\&. When caching is enabled in a SConscript file, any target files built by
\fBscons\fR
will be copied to the cache\&. If an up\-to\-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally\&. Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR, and
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
command\-line options\&. The
\fB\-\-random\fR
option is useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously\&.
.PP
Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s) may be specified on the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons debug=1 \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
These variables are available in SConscript files through the ARGUMENTS dictionary, and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify the build in any way:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
if ARGUMENTS\&.get(\*(Aqdebug\*(Aq, 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = \*(Aq\-g\*(Aq)
else:
    env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The command\-line variable arguments are also available in the ARGLIST list, indexed by their order on the command line\&. This allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary\&. ARGLIST[0] returns a tuple containing (argname, argvalue)\&. A Python exception is thrown if you try to access a list member that does not exist\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
requires either Python 2\&.7 or Python 3\&.5 or higher\&. There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run
\fBscons\&.\fR
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
knows how to search for available programming tools on various systems\&. On Windows systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler\&. On OS/2 systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP\-UX, and Sun Solaris systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain\&. On all other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the GCC tool chain, the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, and the Intel compiler tools\&. You may, of course, override these default values by appropriate configuration of Environment construction variables\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
In general,
\fBscons\fR
supports the same command\-line options as GNU
\fBmake\fR, and many of those supported by
\fBcons\fR\&.
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Ignored for compatibility with non\-GNU versions of
\fBmake\&.\fR
.RE
.PP
\-c, \-\-clean, \-\-remove
.RS 4
Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction command is specified\&. Also remove any files or directories associated to the construction command using the
\fBClean\fR() function\&. Will not remove any targets specified by the
\fBNoClean\fR() function\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-debug=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Print debug information about the
\fBCacheDir\fR() derived\-file caching to the specified
\fIfile\fR\&. If
\fIfile\fR
is
\fB\-\fR
(a hyphen), the debug information are printed to the standard output\&. The printed messages describe what signature file names are being looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the
\fBCacheDir\fR() directory tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-disable, \-\-no\-cache
.RS 4
Disable the derived\-file caching specified by
\fBCacheDir\fR()\&.
\fBscons\fR
will neither retrieve files from the cache nor copy files to the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-force, \-\-cache\-populate
.RS 4
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR(), populate a cache by copying any already\-existing, up\-to\-date derived files to the cache, in addition to files built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a new cache with all the current derived files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently built with caching disabled via the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-readonly
.RS 4
Use the cache (if enabled) for reading, but do not not update the cache with changed files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-show
.RS 4
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR() and retrieving a derived file from the cache, show the command that would have been executed to build the file, instead of the usual report, "Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache\&." This will produce consistent output for build logs, regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=\fImode\fR
.RS 4
This specifies how the
\fBConfigure\fR
call should use or generate the results of configuration tests\&. The option should be specified from among the following choices:
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=auto
.RS 4
scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not\&. This saves time by not running the same configuration tests every time you invoke scons, but will overlook changes in system header files or external commands (such as compilers) if you don\*(Aqt specify those dependecies explicitly\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=force
.RS 4
If this option is specified, all configuration tests will be re\-run regardless of whether the cached results are out of date\&. This can be used to explicitly force the configuration tests to be updated in response to an otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or compiler\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=cache
.RS 4
If this option is specified, no configuration tests will be rerun and all results will be taken from cache\&. Note that scons will still consider it an error if \-\-config=cache is specified and a necessary test does not yet have any results in the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C\fI directory\fR, \-\-directory=\fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Change to the specified
\fIdirectory\fR
before searching for the
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR,
\fIsconstruct\fR,
\fISConstruct\&.py\fR
\fISconstruct\&.py\fR
or
\fIsconstruct\&.py\fR
file, or doing anything else\&. Multiple
\fB\-C\fR
options are interpreted relative to the previous one, and the right\-most
\fB\-C\fR
option wins\&. (This option is nearly equivalent to
\fB\-f directory/SConstruct\fR, except that it will search for
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR,
\fIsconstruct\fR,
\fISConstruct\&.py\fR
\fISconstruct\&.py\fR
or
\fIsconstruct\&.py\fR
in the specified directory\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
Works exactly the same way as the
\fB\-u\fR
option except for the way default targets are handled\&. When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line, all default targets are built, whether or not they are below the current directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=\fItype\fR[\fI,type\fR\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
Debug the build process\&.
\fItype\fR
specifies the kind of debugging info to emit\&. Multiple types may be specified, separated by commas\&. The following entries show the recognized types:
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=action\-timestamps
.RS 4
Prints additional time profiling information\&. For each command, shows the absolute start and end times\&. This may be useful in debugging parallel builds\&. Implies the
\fB\-\-debug=time\fR
option\&.
.sp
Since
scons
3\&.1\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=count
.RS 4
Print how many objects are created of the various classes used internally by SCons before and after reading the SConscript files and before and after building targets\&. This is not supported when SCons is executed with the Python
\fB\-O\fR
(optimized) option or when the SCons modules have been compiled with optimization (that is, when executing from
\fB*\&.pyo\fR
files)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=duplicate
.RS 4
Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant file from its source file\&. Includes debugging info for unlinking stale variant files, as well as unlinking old targets before building them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=explain
.RS 4
Print an explanation of precisely why
\fBscons\fR
is deciding to (re\-)build any targets\&. (Note: this does not print anything for targets that are
\fInot\fR
rebuilt\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=findlibs
.RS 4
Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print a message about each potential library name it is searching for, and about the actual libraries it finds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=includes
.RS 4
Print the include tree after each top\-level target is built\&. This is generally used to find out what files are included by the sources of a given derived file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons \-\-debug=includes foo\&.o
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=memoizer
.RS 4
Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an internal subsystem that counts how often SCons uses cached values in memory instead of recomputing them each time they\*(Aqre needed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=memory
.RS 4
Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading the SConscript files and before and after building targets\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=objects
.RS 4
Prints a list of the various objects of the various classes used internally by SCons\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=pdb
.RS 4
Re\-run SCons under the control of the pdb Python debugger\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=prepare
.RS 4
Print a line each time any target (internal or external) is prepared for building\&.
\fBscons\fR
prints this for each target it considers, even if that target is up to date (see also \-\-debug=explain)\&. This can help debug problems with targets that aren\*(Aqt being built; it shows whether
\fBscons\fR
is at least considering them or not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=presub
.RS 4
Print the raw command line used to build each target before the construction environment variables are substituted\&. Also shows which targets are being built by this command\&. Output looks something like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

(When
\fBscons\fR
is executed without the
\fB\-j\fR
option, the elapsed wall\-clock time will typically be slightly longer than the total time spent executing all the build commands, due to the SCons processing that takes place in between executing each command\&. When
\fBscons\fR
is executed
\fIwith\fR
the
\fB\-j\fR
option, and your build configuration allows good parallelization, the elapsed wall\-clock time should be significantly smaller than the total time spent executing all the build commands, since multiple build commands and intervening SCons processing should take place in parallel\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-diskcheck=\fItypes\fR
.RS 4
Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on disk where the SCons configuration expects a directory (or vice versa), and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist when searching for source and include files\&. The
\fItypes\fR
argument can be set to:
\fBall\fR, to enable all checks explicitly (the default behavior);
\fBnone\fR, to disable all such checks;
\fBmatch\fR, to check that files and directories on disk match SCons\*(Aq expected configuration;
\fBrcs\fR, to check for the existence of an RCS source for any missing source or include files;
\fBsccs\fR, to check for the existence of an SCCS source for any missing source or include files\&. Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas; for example,
\fB\-\-diskcheck=sccs,rcs\fR
would still check for SCCS and RCS sources, but disable the check for on\-disk matches of files and directories\&. Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a performance boost for large configurations, or when the configuration will check for files and/or directories across networked or shared file systems, at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build or of not handling errors gracefully (if include files really should be found in SCCS or RCS, for example, or if a file really does exist where the SCons configuration expects a directory)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-duplicate=\fIORDER\fR
.RS 4
There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links, soft (symbolic) links and copies\&. The default behaviour of SCons is to prefer hard links to soft links to copies\&. You can specify different behaviours with this option\&.

\fIhard\-soft\-copy\fR
(the default),
\fIsoft\-hard\-copy\fR,

A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript files communicate build information to

\fBEnvironment\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Variables, called
\fIconstruction\fR
\fIvariables\fR, may be set in a construction environment either by specifying them as keywords when the object is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(FOO = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
env[\*(AqBAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by the
\fBparse_flags\fR
keyword argument, which applies the
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
method (described below) to the argument value after all other processing is completed\&. This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the flags are distributed to a number of construction variables\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(parse_flags=\*(Aq\-Iinclude \-DEBUG \-lm\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\

This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to
\fBCPPPATH\fR, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fBCPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fBLIBS\fR\&.
.PP
By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of builder methods and construction variables that are appropriate for the current platform\&. An optional platform keyword argument may be used to specify that an environment should be initialized for a different platform:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction variables in the environment to use and generate file names with prefixes and suffixes appropriate for the platform\&.
.PP
Note that the
\fBwin32\fR
platform adds the
\fBSystemDrive\fR
and
\fBSystemRoot\fR
variables from the user\*(Aqs external environment to the construction environment\*(Aqs
\fBENV\fR
dictionary\&. This is so that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with other systems (such as fetching source files from external CVS repository specifications like
\fB:pserver:anonymous@cvs\&.sourceforge\&.net:/cvsroot/scons\fR) will work on Windows systems\&.
.PP
The platform argument may be function or callable object, in which case the Environment() method will call the specified argument to update the new construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_platform(env):
    env[\*(AqVAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)
.fi
.if n \{\

Additionally, a specific set of tools with which to initialize the environment may be specified using the optional keyword argument
\fItools\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqmsvc\*(Aq, \*(Aqlex\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fItools\fR
argument overrides the tool list, it does not add to it, so be sure to include all the tools you need\&. For example if you are building a c/c++ program you must add a tool for both compiler and linker, as in
tools=[\*(Aqclang\*(Aq, \*(Aqlink\*(Aq]\&. The tool name
\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq
can be used to retain the default list\&.
.PP
Non\-built\-in tools may be specified using the optional
\fItoolpath\fR
keyword argument:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq], toolpath=[\*(Aqtools\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This looks for a tool specification in
tools/foo\&.py
as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform\&.
.PP
A tool specification must include two functions:
\fBgenerate(env, **kw)\fR
and
\fBexists(env)\fR\&. The
\fBgenerate\fR
function modifies the environment referenced by
\fIenv\fR
to set up variables so that the tool can be executed; it may use any keyword arguments that the user supplies in
\fIkw\fR
(see below) to vary its initialization\&. The
\fBexists\fR
function should return a true value if the tool is available\&.
.PP
Tools in the toolpath are used before any of the built\-in ones\&. For example, adding
gcc\&.py
to the toolpath would override the built\-in gcc tool\&. Also note that the toolpath is stored in the environment for use by later calls to
\fBClone\fR() and
\fBTool\fR() methods:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
base = Environment(toolpath=[\*(Aqcustom_path\*(Aq])
derived = base\&.Clone(tools=[\*(Aqcustom_tool\*(Aq])
derived\&.CustomBuilder()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The elements of the tools list may also be functions or callable objects, in which case the Environment() method will call the specified elements to update the new construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_tool(env):
    env[\*(AqXYZZY\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The individual elements of the tools list may also themselves be two\-element lists of the form (\fItoolname\fR,
\fIkw_dict\fR)\&. SCons searches for the
\fItoolname\fR
specification file as described above, and passes
\fIkw_dict\fR, which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool\*(Aqs
\fBgenerate\fR
function\&. The
\fBgenerate\fR
function can use the arguments to modify the tool\*(Aqs behavior by setting up the environment in different ways or otherwise changing its initialization\&.

If no tool list is specified, then SCons will auto\-detect the installed tools using the PATH variable in the ENV construction variable and the platform name when the Environment is constructed\&.

docbook
.RS 4
This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little easier\&. It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF\&. Contained in the package is a distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1\&.76\&.1\&. As long as you don\*(Aqt specify your own stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default\&.\&.\&.which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for you\&.
.sp
Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML requirements\&. The additional stylesheet
utils/xmldepend\&.xsl
by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose\&.
.sp
Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that\*(Aqs it\&. The rest lies in your hands and you still have to know what you\*(Aqre doing when resolving names via a catalog\&.
.sp
For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\

xsltproc
processor, and a PDF renderer, e\&.g\&.
fop\&. So make sure that these are added to your system\*(Aqs environment
PATH
and can be called directly, without specifying their full path\&.

the main target is always named
index\&.html, i\&.e\&. the output name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the stylesheets\&.

As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name\&. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

.if n \{\

.sp
Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files, e\&.g\&.
html\&.xsl
for HTML and
pdf\&.xsl
for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL name is provided\&. These are:

.SS "Builder Methods"
.PP
You tell
\fBscons\fR
what to build by calling Builders, functions which know to take a particular action when given files of a particular type to produce a particular result type\&.
\fBscons\fR
defines a number of builders, and you can also write your own\&. Builders are attached to a
construction environment
as methods, and the available builder methods are listed as key\-value pairs in the
\fBBUILDERS\fR
attribute of the
construction environment\&. The available builders can be displayed like this for debugging purposes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
print("Builders:", list(env[\*(AqBUILDERS\*(Aq]))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Builder methods always take two arguments:
\fItarget\fR
(a target or a list of targets to be built) and
\fIsource\fR
(a source or list of sources to be used as input when building), although in some circumstances, the target argument can actually be omitted (see below)\&. Builder methods also take a variety of keyword arguments, described below\&.
.PP
Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting,
\fBscons\fR
supplies a
\fBSplit\fR
global function and a same\-named environment method that split a single string into a list, separated on strings of white\-space characters\&. (These are similar to the Python string
\fBsplit\fR
method, but work even if the input isn\*(Aqt a string\&.)
.PP
The target and source arguments to a builder method can be specified either as positional arguments, in which case the target comes first, or as keyword arguments, using
\fItarget=\fR
and
\fIsource=\fR\&. The following are equivalent examples of calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, [\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq])
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))

env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq\&.split())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Python follows the POSIX pathname convention for path strings: if a string begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows both the slash and backslash separator work, and any leading drive specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path\&. If the path string contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the current directory\&. If it contains separator characters, the search follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative path\&.
.PP

\fBscons\fR
recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string begins with the
\fB#\fR
character it is top\-relative \- it works like a relative path but the search follows down from the directory containing the top\-level
\fBSConstruct\fR
rather than from the current directory (the # is allowed to be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if found in that position)\&. Top\-relative paths only work in places where
scons
will interpret the path (see some examples below)\&. To be used in other contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or absolute path first\&.
.PP
Target and source pathnames can be absolute, relative, or top\-relative\&. Relative pathnames are searched considering the directory of the
\fBSConscript\fR
file currently being processed as the "current directory"\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir"\&.

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq/tmp/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# An initial \*(Aq#\*(Aq or \*(Aq#/\*(Aq are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top\-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo\&.c" and
# "subdir/bar\&.c", respectively:
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top\-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#other/foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely, and
\fBscons\fR
will deduce the target file name from the source file name\&. The following examples all build the executable program
\fBbar\fR
(on POSIX systems) or
\fBbar\&.exe\fR
(on Windows systems) from the
bar\&.c
source file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a convenience, a
\fBsrcdir\fR
keyword argument may be specified when calling a Builder\&. When specified, all source file strings that are not absolute paths or top\-relative paths will be interpreted relative to the specified
\fBsrcdir\fR\&. The following example will build the
build/prog
(or
build/prog\&.exe
on Windows) program from the files
src/f1\&.c
and
src/f2\&.c:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbuild/prog\*(Aq, [\*(Aqf1\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqf2\&.c\*(Aq], srcdir=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
It is possible to
\fIoverride\fR
(replace or add) construction variables when calling a builder method by passing them as keyword arguments\&. These overrides will only be in effect when building that target, and will not affect other parts of the build\&. For example, if you want to specify some libraries needed by just one program:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, LIBS=[\*(Aqgl\*(Aq, \*(Aqglut\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or generate a shared library with a non\-standard suffix:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq,
                  SHLIBSUFFIX=\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq,
                  LIBSUFFIXES=[\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
(Note that both the $SHLIBSUFFIX and $LIBSUFFIXES variables must be set if you want SCons to search automatically for dependencies on the non\-standard library names; see the descriptions of these variables, below, for more information\&.)
.PP
It is also possible to use the
\fBparse_flags\fR
keyword argument in an override, to merge command\-line style arguments into the appropriate construction variables (see
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR)\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, parse_flags=\*(Aq\-Iinclude \-DEBUG \-lm\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to
\fBCPPPATH\fR, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fBCPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fBLIBS\fR\&.
.PP
Although the builder methods defined by
\fBscons\fR
are, in fact, methods of a construction environment object, they may also be called without an explicit environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq)
SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In this case, the methods are called internally using a default construction environment that consists of the tools and values that
\fBscons\fR
has determined are appropriate for the local system\&.
.PP
Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
All builder methods return a list\-like object containing Nodes that will be built\&. A
\fINode\fR
is an internal SCons object which represents build targets or sources\&.
.PP
The returned Node\-list object can be passed to other builder methods as source(s) or passed to any SCons function or method where a filename would normally be accepted\&. For example, if it were necessary to add a specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(source = [\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq, bar_obj_list, \*(Aqmain\&.c\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Using a Node in this way makes for a more portable build by avoiding having to specify a platform\-specific object suffix when calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method\&.
.PP
Note that builder calls will automatically "flatten" the source and target file lists, so it\*(Aqs all right to have the
bar_obj_list
returned by the
\fBStaticObject\fR
call in the middle of the source file list\&. If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly using Python, you can either build the list by hand:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = [\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq] + foo + [\*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq] + bar + [\*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq]
for object in objects:
    print(str(object))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you can use the
\fBFlatten\fR
function supplied by scons to create a list containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = Flatten([\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq, foo, \*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq, bar, \*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq])
for object in objects:
    print(str(object))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note also that because builder calls return a list\-like object, not an actual Python list, you should
\fInot\fR
use the Python add operator (+
or
+=) to append builder results to a Python list\&. Because the list and the object are different types, Python will not update the original list in place, but will instead create a new Node\-list object containing the concatenation of the list elements and the builder results\&. This will cause problems for any other Python variables in your SCons configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list\&. Instead, use the Python list
\fBextend\fR
method to make sure the list is updated in\-place\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += as follows:
#
#    object_files += Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place\&.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files\&.extend(Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq))

.fi

Builder calls support a
\fBchdir\fR
keyword argument that specifies that the Builder\*(Aqs action(s) should be executed after changing directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
is not a string or Node and is non\-zero, then scons will change to the target file\*(Aqs directory\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

Note that scons will

when using the chdir keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the top\-level SConstruct directory, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. If you use the chdir keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different command line using expansions like

to use just the filename portion of the targets and source\&.

Note that because
SCons
always executes its build commands from the directory in which the
SConstruct
file is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the
SConstruct
directory, users will not be able to double\-click on the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the Visual Studio console output window\&. This can be remedied by adding the Visual C/C++
/FC
compiler option to the

Starting with version 2\&.4 of SCons it is also possible to specify the optional argument
\fIDebugSettings\fR, which creates files for debugging under Visual Studio:
.PP
DebugSettings
.RS 4
A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the
\&.vcproj\&.user
or the
\&.vcxproj\&.user
file, depending on the version installed\&. As it is done for cmdargs (see above), you can specify a
\fIDebugSettings\fR
dictionary per variant\&. If you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants\&.
.RE
.sp
Currently, only Visual Studio v9\&.0 and Visual Studio version v11 are implemented, for other versions no file is generated\&. To generate the user file, you just need to add a
\fIDebugSettings\fR
dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your MSVS version\&. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain any good value, no file will be generated\&.

The last approach is perhaps the recommended one\&. It allows easily split internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to
PO
files) and script(s) under variant directories are responsible for compilation of
PO
to
MO
files to and for installation of
MO
files\&. The "gluing factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of
LINGUAS
file\&. Note, that the updated
POT
and
PO
files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source directory (and not in variant directories)\&. Additionaly, the file listing of
po/
directory contains
LINGUAS
file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the project in their usual way\&.

.SS "Methods and Functions to Do Things"
.PP
In addition to Builder methods,
\fBscons\fR
provides a number of other construction environment methods and global functions to manipulate the build configuration\&.
.PP
Usually, a construction environment method and global function with the same name both exist so that you don\*(Aqt have to remember whether to a specific bit of functionality must be called with or without a construction environment\&. In the following list, if you call something as a global function it looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Function(\fIarguments\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
and if you call something through a construction environment it looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Function(\fIarguments\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If you can call the functionality in both ways, then both forms are listed\&.
.PP
Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Except where otherwise noted, the same\-named construction environment method and global function provide the exact same functionality\&. The only difference is that, where appropriate, calling the functionality through a construction environment will substitute construction variables into any supplied strings\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(FOO = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)
env\&.Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In the above example, the first call to the global
\fBDefault()\fR
function will actually add a target named
\fB$FOO\fR
to the list of default targets, while the second call to the
\fBenv\&.Default()\fR
construction environment method will expand the value and add a target named
\fBfoo\fR
to the list of default targets\&. For more on construction variable expansion, see the next section on construction variables\&.
.PP
Construction environment methods and global functions supported by
\fBscons\fR
include:
.PP
Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [option=value, \&.\&.\&.]), env\&.Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [option=value, \&.\&.\&.])
.RS 4
Creates an Action object for the specified

.sp
Note that the
\fBenv\&.Action\fR() form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any argument strings, including the
\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the
\fIenv\fR
construction environment through which
\fBenv\&.Action\fR() was called\&. The

\fIoptparse\fR, with a few additional capabilities noted below; see the documentation for
\fIoptparse\fR
for a thorough discussion of its option\-processing capabities\&.
.sp
In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
\fBoptparse\&.add_option\fR() method, the SCons
\fBAddOption\fR
function allows you to set the
nargs
keyword value to
\*(Aq?\*(Aq
(a string with just the question mark) to indicate that the specified long option(s) take(s) an
\fIoptional\fR
argument\&. When
nargs = \*(Aq?\*(Aq
is passed to the
\fBAddOption\fR
function, the
const
keyword argument may be used to supply the "default" value that should be used when the option is specified on the command line without an explicit argument\&.
.sp
If no
default=
keyword argument is supplied when calling
\fBAddOption\fR, the option will have a default value of
None\&.
.sp
Unlike regular
\fIoptparse\fR, option names added via
\fBAddOption\fR
must be matched exactly, the automatic matching of abbreviations on the command line for long options is not supported\&. To allow specific abbreviations, include them in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call\&.
.sp
Once a new command\-line option has been added with
\fBAddOption\fR, the option value may be accessed using
\fBGetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.GetOption\fR()\&.

\fBSetOption\fR
is not currently supported for options added with
\fBAddOption\fR\&.
.sp
Any specified
help=
strings for the new option(s) will be displayed by the
\fB\-H\fR

\fB\-h\fR
options (the latter only if no other help text is specified in the SConscript files)\&. The help text for the local options specified by
\fBAddOption\fR

Appends the specified keyword arguments to the end of construction variables in the environment\&.

.RS 4
This appends new path elements to the given path in the specified external environment (ENV

\fBos\&.path\&.normpath\fR

CacheDir(cache_dir), env\&.CacheDir(cache_dir)
.RS 4
Specifies that
scons
will maintain a cache of derived files in
\fIcache_dir\fR\&. The derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds using the same
\fBCacheDir\fR
call\&. Specifying a
\fIcache_dir\fR
of
None
disables derived file caching\&.
.sp
Calling
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR() will only affect targets built through the specified construction environment\&. Calling
\fBCacheDir\fR
sets a global default that will be used by all targets built through construction environments that do
\fInot\fR
have an
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR() specified\&.
.sp
When a
\fBCacheDir\fR() is being used and
scons
finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the cache to see if a derived file has already been built from identical input files and an identical build action (as incorporated into the MD5 build signature)\&. If so,
scons
will retrieve the file from the cache\&. If the derived file is not present in the cache,
scons
will rebuild it and then place a copy of the built file in the cache (identified by its MD5 build signature), so that it may be retrieved by other builds that need to build the same derived file from identical inputs\&.
.sp
Use of a specified
\fBCacheDir\fR
may be disabled for any invocation by using the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
option\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR
option is used,
scons
will place a copy of
\fIall\fR
derived files in the cache, even if they already existed and were not built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a cache the first time
\fBCacheDir\fR
is added to a build, or after using the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
option\&.
.sp
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR,
scons
will report, "Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache," unless the
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
option is being used\&. When the
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
option is used,
scons
will print the action that
\fIwould\fR
have been used to build the file, without any indication that the file was actually retrieved from the cache\&. This is useful to generate build logs that are equivalent regardless of whether a given derived file has been built in\-place or retrieved from the cache\&.

The
\fBNoCache\fR

Executes a specific action (or list of actions) to build a target file or files\&. This is more convenient than defining a separate Builder object for a single special\-case build\&.
.sp

\fBCommand\fR
builder accepts
\fIsource_scanner\fR,
\fItarget_scanner\fR,
\fIsource_factory\fR, and
\fItarget_factory\fR
keyword arguments\&. The *_scanner args can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be used to apply a custom scanner for a source or target\&. For example, the global
DirScanner
object can be used if any of the sources will be directories that must be scanned on\-disk for changes to files that aren\*(Aqt already specified in other Builder of function calls\&. The *_factory args take a factory function that the Command will use to turn any sources or targets specified as strings into SCons Nodes\&. See the sections "Builder Objects" below, for more information about how these args work in a Builder\&.
.sp
Any other keyword arguments specified override any same\-named existing construction variables\&.
.sp
An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action Objects" for more complete information\&. Also note that a string specifying an external command may be preceded by an
@
(at\-sign) to suppress printing the command in question, or by a
\-

may be an Action object (see manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior), or it may be a command\-line string, list of commands, or executable Python function, each of which will be converted into an Action object and then executed\&. The exit value of the command or return value of the Python function will be returned\&.
.sp
Note that
scons

scons
will
\fInot\fR, however, automatically terminate the build if the specified

.PP
Export(vars), env\&.Export(vars)
.RS 4
This tells
scons
to export a list of variables from the current SConscript file to all other SConscript files\&. The exported variables are kept in a global collection, so subsequent calls to
\fBExport\fR
will over\-write previous exports that have the same name\&. Multiple variable names can be passed to
\fBExport\fR
as separate arguments or as a list\&. Keyword arguments can be used to provide names and their values\&. A dictionary can be used to map variables to a different name when exported\&. Both local variables and global variables can be exported\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import()\&.
Export("env")

package = \*(Aqmy_name\*(Aq

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug":env})
.fi

Note that the
\fBSConscript\fR

\fIdirectory\fR

If
\fIname\fR
is a list, SCons returns a list of File nodes\&. Construction variables are expanded in
\fIname\fR\&.

FindPathDirs(variable)
.RS 4
Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended to be used as the

\fIvariable\fR
in a construction environment and treat the construction variable\*(Aqs value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
\fB$CPPPATH\fR,
\fB$LIBPATH\fR, etc\&.)\&.
.sp
Note that use of
\fBFindPathDirs\fR
is generally preferable to writing your own
\fIpath_function\fR
for the following reasons: 1) The returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in source trees (when
\fBVariantDir\fR
is used) or in code repositories (when
\fBRepository\fR

Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built files\&. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at the optional argument
\fInode\fR
which defaults to the \*(Aq"\&."\*(Aq\-node\&. It will then return all leaves of

Flatten(sequence), env\&.Flatten(sequence)
.RS 4
Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing all of the individual elements in any sequence\&. This can be helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders; other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not\&.
.sp
Examples:

objects = [\*(Aqf1\&.o\*(Aq, foo, \*(Aqf2\&.o\*(Aq, bar, \*(Aqf3\&.o\*(Aq]

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because

GetBuildFailures()
.RS 4
Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while attempting to build targets\&. Each element in the returned list is a
BuildError
object with the following attributes that record various aspects of the build failure:
.sp

\&.node
The node that was being built when the build failure occurred\&.
.sp

\&.status
The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to build the specified Node\&.
.sp

\&.errstr
The SCons error string describing the build failure\&. (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that an executed command exited with a status of 2\&.)
.sp

\&.filename
The name of the file or directory that actually caused the failure\&. This may be different from the
\&.node
attribute\&. For example, if an attempt to build a target named
sub/dir/target
fails because the
sub/dir
directory could not be created, then the
\&.node
attribute will be
sub/dir/target
but the
\&.filename
attribute will be
sub/dir\&.
.sp

\&.executor
The SCons Executor object for the target Node being built\&. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment used for the failed action\&.
.sp

\&.action
The actual SCons Action object that failed\&. This will be one specific action out of the possible list of actions that would have been executed to build the target\&.
.sp

\&.command
The actual expanded command that was executed and failed, after expansion of
\fB$TARGET\fR,
\fB$SOURCE\fR, and other construction variables\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
function will always return an empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means that
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
will always return an empty list while the
SConscript

Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude]), env\&.Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
.RS 4
Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified
\fIpattern\fR, relative to the directory of the current
SConscript
file\&. The
\fBenv\&.Glob\fR() form performs string substition on
\fIpattern\fR
and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern\&.
.sp
The specified

uses Unix shell style metacharacters for matching:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first character of a filename is a dot, it must be matched explicitly\&. Character matches do
\fInot\fR
span directory separators\&.
.sp
The
\fBGlob\fR
knows about repositories (see the
\fBRepository\fR
function) and source directories (see the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) in the local (SConscript) directory if matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory\&.
.sp
The
\fIondisk\fR
argument may be set to
False
(or any other non\-true value) to disable the search for matches on disk, thereby only returning matches among already\-configured File or Dir Nodes\&. The default behavior is to return corresponding Nodes for any on\-disk matches found\&.
.sp
The
\fIsource\fR
argument may be set to
True
(or any equivalent value) to specify that, when the local directory is a
\fBVariantDir\fR, the returned Nodes should be from the corresponding source directory, not the local directory\&.
.sp
The
\fIstrings\fR
argument may be set to
True
(or any equivalent value) to have the
\fBGlob\fR
function return strings, not Nodes, that represent the matched files or directories\&. The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory\&. (Note that This may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, but if the returned strings are passed to a different
SConscript
file, any Node translation will be relative to the other
SConscript
directory, not the original
SConscript
directory\&.)
.sp
The
\fIexclude\fR
argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns (following the same Unix shell semantics) which must be filtered out of returned elements\&. Elements matching a least one pattern of this list will be excluded\&.

env\&.ParseFlags(flags, \&.\&.\&.)
.RS 4
Parses one or more strings containing typical command\-line flags for GCC tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag values separated into the appropriate SCons construction variables\&. This is intended as a companion to the
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
method, but allows for the values in the returned dictionary to be modified, if necessary, before merging them into the construction environment\&. (Note that
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
will call this method if its argument is not a dictionary, so it is usually not necessary to call
\fBenv\&.ParseFlags\fR
directly unless you want to manipulate the values\&.)
.sp
If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!), the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command\-line flags and added to the resulting dictionary\&.
.sp
Flag values are translated accordig to the prefix found, and added to the following construction variables:

Appends the specified keyword arguments to the beginning of construction variables in the environment\&. If the Environment does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply added to the environment\&. If the values of the construction variable and the keyword argument are the same type, then the two values will be simply added together\&. Otherwise, the construction variable and the value of the keyword argument are both coerced to lists, and the lists are added together\&. (See also the Append method, above\&.)

This appends new path elements to the given path in the specified external environment (\fB$ENV\fR

If

If the construction variable being appended to is a list, then any value(s) that already exist in the construction variable will
\fInot\fR
be added again to the list\&. However, if delete_existing is 1, existing matching values are removed first, so existing values in the arg list move to the front of the list\&.

Progress(callable, [interval]), Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite]), Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])
.RS 4
Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes (e\&.g\&. files)\&.
.sp
If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function or an object that has a
\fB__call__\fR() method), the function will be called once every
\fIinterval\fR
times a Node is evaluated\&. The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument\&. (For future compatibility, it\*(Aqs a good idea to also add
*args
and
**kw
as arguments to your function or method\&. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons ever changes the interface to call the function with additional arguments in the future\&.)
.sp
An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kw):
    print(\*(AqEvaluating node %s!\*(Aq % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated Nodes\&. Note the use of
\er
(a carriage return) at the end so that the string will overwrite itself on a display:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self\&.count += 100
        sys\&.stderr\&.write(\*(AqEvaluated %s nodes\er\*(Aq % self\&.count)
Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument
\fBProgress\fR
is a string, the string will be displayed every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. The default is to print the string on standard output; an alternate output stream may be specified with the
file=
argument\&. The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq, interval=100, file=sys\&.stderr)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the string contains the verbatim substring
\fB$TARGET\fR, it will be replaced with the Node\&. Note that, for performance reasons, this is
\fInot\fR
a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not use other variables or use curly braces\&. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a
\er
(carriage return) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the
overwrite=
keyword argument to make sure the previously\-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq$TARGET\er\*(Aq, overwrite=True)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument to
\fBProgress\fR
is a list of strings, then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. This can be used to implement a "spinner" on the user\*(Aqs screen as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Progress([\*(Aq\-\er\*(Aq, \*(Aq\e\e\er\*(Aq, \*(Aq|\er\*(Aq, \*(Aq/\er\*(Aq], interval=5)

.sp
To
scons, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the top\-level directory on down, which may contain both source files and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local source tree\&. The canonical example would be an official source tree maintained by an integrator\&. If the repository contains derived files, then the derived files should have been built using
scons, so that the repository contains the necessary signature information to allow
scons
to figure out when it is appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file, instead of building one locally\&.
.sp
Note that if an up\-to\-date derived file already exists in a repository,
scons

.RS 4
This tells
scons
to execute one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files\&. Any variables returned by a called script using
\fBReturn\fR
will be returned by the call to
\fBSConscript\fR\&. There are two ways to call the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&.
.sp
The first way you can call
\fBSConscript\fR
is to explicitly specify one or more
\fIscripts\fR
as the first argument\&. A single script may be specified as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as a list (either explicitly or as created by a function like
\fBSplit\fR)\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq)      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript([\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc/SConscript\*(Aq])
config = SConscript(\*(AqMyConfig\&.py\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The second way you can call
\fBSConscript\fR
is to specify a list of (sub)directory names as a
dirs=\fIsubdirs\fR
keyword argument\&. In this case,
scons
will, by default, execute a subsidiary configuration file named
SConscript
in each of the specified directories\&. You may specify a name other than
SConscript
by supplying an optional
name=\fIscript\fR
keyword argument\&. The first three examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)    # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsub1\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub2\*(Aq], name=\*(AqMySConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The optional
\fIexports\fR
argument provides a list of variable names or a dictionary of named values to export to the
\fIscript(s)\fR\&. These variables are locally exported only to the specified
\fIscript(s)\fR, and do not affect the global pool of variables used by the
\fBExport\fR
function\&.
The subsidiary
\fIscript(s)\fR
must use the
\fBImport\fR
function to import the variables\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = SConscript(\*(Aqsub/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqdir/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=[\*(Aqenv\*(Aq, \*(Aqvariable\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsubdir\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv variable\*(Aq)
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqone\*(Aq, \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq, \*(Aqthree\*(Aq], exports=\*(Aqshared_info\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the optional
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the
\fBVariantDir\fR
method described below\&. (If
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is not present, the

\fIduplicate\fR
argument is ignored\&.) The
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the calling
SConscript
file\&. See the description of the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function below for additional details and restrictions\&.
.sp
If
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is present,
the source directory is the directory in which the
SConscript
file resides and the
SConscript
file is evaluated as if it were in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR
directory:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir = \*(Aqbuild\*(Aq)

.if n \{\

.nf
VariantDir(\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq, \*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqbuild/SConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
This later paradigm is often used when the sources are in the same directory as the
SConstruct:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir = \*(Aqbuild\*(Aq)

VariantDir(\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq, \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqbuild/SConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

.sp
The optional
\fImust_exist\fR
argument, if true, causes an exception to be raised if a requested
SConscript
file is not found\&. The current default is false, causing only a warning to be omitted, but this behavior is deprecated\&. For scripts which truly intend to be optional, transition to explicty supplying

SideEffect(side_effect, target), env\&.SideEffect(side_effect, target)
.RS 4
Declares
\fIside_effect\fR
as a side effect of building
\fItarget\fR\&. Both
\fIside_effect\fR
and
\fItarget\fR
can be a list, a file name, or a node\&. A side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a side effect of building other targets\&. For example, a Windows PDB file is created as a side effect of building the \&.obj files for a static library, and various log files are created updated as side effects of various TeX commands\&. If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands,
scons
will ensure that only one set of commands is executed at a time\&. Consequently, you only need to use this method for side\-effect targets that are built as a result of multiple build commands\&.
.sp
Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect file, by default the
\fIside_effect\fR
target is
\fInot\fR
automatically removed when the
\fItarget\fR
is removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
option\&. (Note, however, that the
\fIside_effect\fR
might be removed as part of cleaning the directory in which it lives\&.) If you want to make sure the
\fIside_effect\fR

\fItarget\fR

\fBClean\fR

SourceCode(entries, builder), env\&.SourceCode(entries, builder)
.RS 4
This function and its associate factory functions are deprecated\&. There is no replacement\&. The intended use was to keep a local tree in sync with an archive, but in actuality the function only causes the archive to be fetched on the first run\&. Synchronizing with the archive is best done external to
SCons\&.
.sp
Arrange for non\-existent source files to be fetched from a source code management system using the specified
\fIbuilder\fR\&. The specified
\fIentries\fR
may be a Node, string or list of both, and may represent either individual source files or directories in which source files can be found\&.
.sp
For any non\-existent source files,
scons
will search up the directory tree and use the first
\fBSourceCode\fR
builder it finds\&. The specified
\fIbuilder\fR
may be
None, in which case
scons
will not use a builder to fetch source files for the specified
\fIentries\fR, even if a
\fBSourceCode\fR
builder has been specified for a directory higher up the tree\&.
.sp

scons
will, by default, fetch files from SCCS or RCS subdirectories without explicit configuration\&. This takes some extra processing time to search for the necessary source code management files on disk\&. You can avoid these extra searches and speed up your build a little by disabling these searches as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.sp
By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from the result\&. and all sequences of white space will be compressed to a single space character\&. Additionally, any
$(

character sequences will be stripped from the returned string, The optional
\fIraw\fR

$(\-$)
sequences\&. The
\fIraw\fR
argument may be set to
2
if you want to strip all characters between any
$(

pairs (as is done for signature calculation)\&.
.sp
If the input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be returned as a list\&.
.sp
The optional
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
keyword arguments must be set to lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
\fB$TARGET\fR,

to be available for expansion\&. This is usually necessary if you are calling
\fBenv\&.subst\fR
from within a Python function used as an SCons action\&.
.sp
Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default\&. The optional
\fIconv\fR
argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in place of the default\&. For example, if you want Python objects (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you can use the Python Λ idiom to pass in an unnamed function that simply returns its unconverted argument\&.

VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate]), env\&.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
.RS 4
Use the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function to create a copy of your sources in another location: if a name under
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is not found but exists under
\fIsrc_dir\fR, the file or directory is copied to
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. Target files can be built in a different directory than the original sources by simply refering to the sources (and targets) within the variant tree\&.
.sp

\fBVariantDir\fR
can be called multiple times with the same
\fIsrc_dir\fR
to set up multiple builds with different options (\fIvariants\fR)\&. The
\fIsrc_dir\fR
location must be in or underneath the SConstruct file\*(Aqs directory, and
\fIvariant_dir\fR
may not be underneath
\fIsrc_dir\fR\&.
.sp
The default behavior is for
scons
to physically duplicate the source files in the variant tree\&. Thus, a build performed in the variant tree is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source tree even if intermediate source files are generated during the build, or preprocessors or other scanners search for included files relative to the source file, or individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard\-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files\&.
.sp
If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying; see also the
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR
command\-line option\&. Moreover, only the files needed for the build are duplicated; files and directories that are not used are not present in
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&.
.sp
Duplicating the source tree may be disabled by setting the
duplicate
argument to
0
(zero)\&. This will cause
scons
to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in
\fIsrc_dir\fR
and the path names of derived files within
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. This is always more efficient than
duplicate=1, and is usually safe for most builds (but see above for cases that may cause problems)\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBVariantDir\fR
works most naturally with a subsidiary SConscript file\&. However, you would then call the subsidiary SConscript file not in the source directory, but in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR, regardless of the value of
duplicate\&. This is how you tell
scons
which variant of a source tree to build:
.sp

The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is
\fB/Z7\fR\&. This works correctly with parallel (\fB\-j\fR) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files\&. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library\&. Using the
\fB/Zi\fR
instead may yield improved link\-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work\&.

You can generate PDB files with the

switch by overriding the default

PDB
.RS 4
The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for object files, shared libraries, and programs\&. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++\&. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate external debugging information, and will also set up the dependencies for the PDB file\&. Example:

.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env[\*(AqPDB\*(Aq] = \*(Aqhello\&.pdb\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is
\fB/Z7\fR\&. This works correctly with parallel (\fB\-j\fR) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files\&. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library\&. Using the
\fB/Zi\fR
instead may yield improved link\-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work\&. You can generate PDB files with the
\fB/Zi\fR
switch by overriding the default

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from header files\&.\fR
You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you\&.

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from cxx files\&.\fR
As stated in the qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx file\&. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated by the transformation ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default <basename>\&.moc\&. A warning is generated after building the moc file, if you do not include the correct file\&. If you are using VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1\&.

specifies a file which collects the output from commands that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc\&. The default is the file #/config\&.log\&. If you are using the
\fBVariantDir\fR() method, you may want to specify a subdirectory under your variant directory\&.
\fIconfig_h\fR
specifies a C header file where the results of tests will be written, e\&.g\&. #define HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc\&. The default is to not write a
\fBconfig\&.h\fR
file\&. You can specify the same
\fBconfig\&.h\fR
file in multiple calls to Configure, in which case
\fBscons\fR

\fIvalidator\fR

\fIconverter\fR
is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and should take either a value, or the value and environment, as parameters\&. The

Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is created (that is, when the Builder() function is called) will be set in the executing construction environment when the Builder object is called\&. The canonical example here would be to set a construction variable to the repository of a source code system\&.
.PP
Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder
\fIobject\fR
is called will only be associated with the target created by that particular Builder call (and any other files built as a result of the call)\&.
.PP
These extra keyword arguments are passed to the following functions: command generator functions, function Actions, and emitter functions\&.
.SS "Action Objects"
.PP
The
\fBBuilder\fR() function will turn its
\fBaction\fR
keyword argument into an appropriate internal Action object\&. You can also explicitly create Action objects using the
\fBAction\fR() global function, which can then be passed to the
\fBBuilder\fR() function\&. This can be used to configure an Action object more flexibly, or it may simply be more efficient than letting each separate Builder object create a separate Action when multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing\&.
.PP
The
\fBAction\fR() global function returns an appropriate object for the action represented by the type of the first argument:
.PP
Action
.RS 4
If the first argument is already an Action object, the object is simply returned\&.
.RE
.PP
String
.RS 4
If the first argument is a string, a command\-line Action is returned\&. Note that the command\-line string may be preceded by an
\fB@\fR
(at\-sign) to suppress printing of the specified command line, or by a
\fB\-\fR
(hyphen) to ignore the exit status from the specified command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
Action(\*(Aq$CC \-c \-o $TARGET $SOURCES\*(Aq)

# Doesn\*(Aqt print the line being executed\&.

# Ignores return value
Action(\*(Aq\-build $TARGET $SOURCES\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
List
.RS 4
If the first argument is a list, then a list of Action objects is returned\&. An Action object is created as necessary for each element in the list\&. If an element
\fIwithin\fR
the list is itself a list, the internal list is the command and arguments to be executed via the command line\&. This allows white space to be enclosed in an argument by defining a command in a list within a list:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Action([[\*(Aqcc\*(Aq, \*(Aq\-c\*(Aq, \*(Aq\-DWHITE SPACE\*(Aq, \*(Aq\-o\*(Aq, \*(Aq$TARGET\*(Aq, \*(Aq$SOURCES\*(Aq]])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
Function
.RS 4
If the first argument is a Python function, a function Action is returned\&. The Python function must take three keyword arguments,
\fBtarget\fR
(a Node object representing the target file),
\fBsource\fR
(a Node object representing the source file) and
\fBenv\fR
(the construction environment used for building the target file)\&. The
\fBtarget\fR
and
\fBsource\fR
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is more than one target file or source file\&. The actual target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node objects via the built\-in Python
\fBstr\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = [str(x) for x in source]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The function should return
0
or
\fBNone\fR
to indicate a successful build of the target file(s)\&. The function may raise an exception or return a non\-zero exit status to indicate an unsuccessful build\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def build_it(target = None, source = None, env = None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

a = Action(build_it)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the action argument is not one of the above, None is returned\&.
.RE
.PP
The second argument is optional and is used to define the output which is printed when the Action is actually performed\&. In the absence of this parameter, or if it\*(Aqs an empty string, a default output depending on the type of the action is used\&. For example, a command\-line action will print the executed command\&. The argument must be either a Python function or a string\&.
.PP
In the first case, it\*(Aqs a function that returns a string to be printed to describe the action being executed\&. The function may also be specified by the
\fIstrfunction\fR= keyword argument\&. Like a function to build a file, this function must take three keyword arguments:
\fBtarget\fR
(a Node object representing the target file),
\fBsource\fR
(a Node object representing the source file) and
\fBenv\fR
(a construction environment)\&. The
\fBtarget\fR
and
\fBsource\fR
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is more than one target file or source file\&.
.PP
In the second case, you provide the string itself\&. The string may also be specified by the
\fIcmdstr\fR= keyword argument\&. The string typically contains variables, notably $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a single variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else\&. SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return "building \*(Aq%s\*(Aq from \*(Aq%s\*(Aq" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument\&.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, "building \*(Aq$TARGET\*(Aq from \*(Aq$SOURCE\*(Aq")

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument\&.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building \*(Aq$TARGET\*(Aq from \*(Aq$SOURCE\*(Aq")

# You can provide a configurable variable\&.
l = Action(build_it, \*(Aq$STRINGIT\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The third and succeeding arguments, if present, may either be a construction variable or a list of construction variables whose values will be included in the signature of the Action when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action changed\&. The variables may also be specified by a
\fIvarlist\fR= keyword parameter; if both are present, they are combined\&. This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt when a specific construction variable changes\&. This is not often needed for a string action, as the expanded variables will normally be part of the command line, but may be needed if a Python function action uses the value of a construction variable when generating the command line\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the \*(AqXXX\*(Aq construction variable
    open(target[0], \*(Aqw\*(Aq)\&.write(env[\*(AqXXX\*(Aq])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments\&.
a = Action(build_it, \*(Aq$STRINGIT\*(Aq, [\*(AqXXX\*(Aq])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument\&.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=[\*(AqXXX\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
Action
global function can be passed the following optional keyword arguments to modify the Action object\*(Aqs behavior:
.PP

\fIchdir\fR
specifies that scons will execute the action after changing to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is not a string or Node and is non\-zero, then scons will change to the target file\*(Aqs directory\&.
.PP
Note that scons will
\fInot\fR
automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like
\fB$TARGET\fR
and
\fB$SOURCE\fR
when using the chdir keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the top\-level SConstruct directory, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. Builders created using chdir keyword argument, will need to use construction variable expansions like
\fB${TARGET\&.file}\fR
and
\fB${SOURCE\&.file}\fR
to use just the filename portion of the targets and source\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE\&.file} > ${TARGET\&.file}",
           chdir=1)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP

\fIexitstatfunc\fR
specifies a function that is passed the exit status (or return value) from the specified action and can return an arbitrary or modified value\&. This can be used, for example, to specify that an Action object\*(Aqs return value should be ignored under special conditions and SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always suceeds:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success\&.
    return 0
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE\&.file} > ${TARGET\&.file}",
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP

\fIbatch_key\fR
specifies that the Action can create multiple target files by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously\&. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such as Microsoft\*(Aqs Visual C / C++ compiler\&.) If the
\fBbatch_key\fR
argument evaluates True and is not a callable object, the configured Action object will cause
\fBscons\fR
to collect all targets built with the Action object and configured with the same construction environment into single invocations of the Action object\*(Aqs command line or function\&. Command lines will typically want to use the
\fBCHANGED_SOURCES\fR
construction variable (and possibly
\fBCHANGED_TARGETS\fR
as well) to only pass to the command line those sources that have actually changed since their targets were built\&.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
a = Action(\*(Aqbuild $CHANGED_SOURCES\*(Aq, batch_key=True)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fBbatch_key\fR
argument may also be a callable function that returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches" of target files to be collected for batch building\&. A
\fBbatch_key\fR
function must accept the following arguments:
.PP
action
.RS 4
The action object\&.
.RE
.PP
env
.RS 4
The construction environment configured for the target\&.
.RE
.PP
target
.RS 4
The list of targets for a particular configured action\&.
.RE
.PP
source
.RS 4
The list of source for a particular configured action\&.
.sp
The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how multiple invocations should be batched\&. For example, a
\fBbatch_key\fR
function may decide to return the value of a specific construction variable from the
\fBenv\fR
argument which will cause
\fBscons\fR
to batch\-build targets with matching values of that variable, or perhaps return the
\fBid\fR() of the entire construction environment, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will batch\-build all targets configured with the same construction environment\&. Returning
\fBNone\fR
indicates that the particular target should
\fInot\fR
be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a separate invocation of action\*(Aqs command or function\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0]\&.dir
    if tdir\&.name == \*(Aqspecial\*(Aq:
        # Don\*(Aqt batch\-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory\&.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action(\*(Aqbuild $CHANGED_SOURCES\*(Aq, batch_key=batch_key)
.fi
.if n \{\

.SS "Miscellaneous Action Functions"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
supplies a number of functions that arrange for various common file and directory manipulations to be performed\&. These are similar in concept to "tasks" in the Ant build tool, although the implementation is slightly different\&. These functions do not actually perform the specified action at the time the function is called, but instead return an Action object that can be executed at the appropriate time\&. (In Object\-Oriented terminology, these are actually Action
\fIFactory\fR
functions that return Action objects\&.)
.PP
In practice, there are two natural ways that these Action Functions are intended to be used\&.
.PP
First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript file is being read, you can use the
\fBExecute\fR
global function to do so:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Execute(Touch(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use by the
\fBCommand\fR
method\&. This can allow you to perform more complicated sequences of file manipulation without relying on platform\-specific external commands:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

Chmod(\fIdest\fR, \fImode\fR)
.RS 4

\fBmust_exist=0\fR, that is, the Action will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist\&. Examples:

You can use this feature to pass arguments to a Python function by creating a callable class that stores one or more arguments in an object, and then uses them when the

according to the current value of

when the command is executed\&. The evaluation takes place when the target is being built, not when the SConscript is being read\&. So if
env[\*(AqCOND\*(Aq]

When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of command line arguments\&.
.RE
.PP
List
.RS 4
When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line arguments\&. Each element of the list is converted to a string\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
Newline
.RS 4
Newline characters (\en) delimit lines\&. The newline parsing is done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e\&.g\&. file names) to contain embedded newline characters\&. This limitation will likely go away in a future version of SCons\&.
.RE
.SS "Scanner Objects"
.PP
You can use the
\fBScanner\fR
function to define objects to scan new file types for implicit dependencies\&. The
\fBScanner\fR
function accepts the following arguments:
.PP
function
.RS 4
This can be either: 1) a Python function that will process the Node (file) and return a list of File Nodes representing the implicit dependencies (file names) found in the contents; or: 2) a dictionary that maps keys (typically the file suffix, but see below for more discussion) to other Scanners that should be called\&.
.sp
If the argument is actually a Python function, the function must take three or four arguments:
.sp
def scanner_function(node, env, path):
.sp
def scanner_function(node, env, path, arg=None):
.sp
The
\fBnode\fR
argument is the internal SCons node representing the file\&. Use
\fBstr(node)\fR
to fetch the name of the file, and
\fBnode\&.get_contents()\fR
to fetch contents of the file\&. Note that the file is
\fInot\fR
guaranteed to exist before the scanner is called, so the scanner function should check that if there\*(Aqs any chance that the scanned file might not exist (for example, if it\*(Aqs built from other files)\&.
.sp
The
\fBenv\fR
argument is the construction environment for the scan\&. Fetch values from it using the
\fBenv\&.Dictionary()\fR
method or using the key lookup operator directly on the construction environment\&.
.sp
The
\fBpath\fR
argument is a tuple (or list) of directories that can be searched for files\&. This will usually be the tuple returned by the
\fBpath_function\fR
argument (see below)\&.
.sp
The
\fBarg\fR
argument is the argument supplied when the scanner was created, if any\&.

.RE
.PP
skeys
.RS 4
An optional list that can be used to determine which scanner should be used for a given Node\&. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan\&. If the argument is a string, then it will be expanded into a list by the current environment\&.
.RE
.PP
path_function
.RS 4
A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a construction environment, a Node for the directory containing the SConscript file in which the first target was defined, a list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and an optional argument supplied when the scanner was created\&. The
\fBpath_function\fR
returns a tuple of directories that can be searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object\&. (Note that the
\fBFindPathDirs\fR() function can be used to return a ready\-made
\fBpath_function\fR
for a given construction variable name, instead of having to write your own function from scratch\&.)
.RE
.PP
node_class

\fBnode_factory\fR

.RE
.PP
node_factory
.RS 4
A Python function that will take a string or other object and turn it into the appropriate class of Node to be returned by this Scanner object\&.
.RE
.PP
scan_check
.RS 4
An optional Python function that takes two arguments, a Node (file) and a construction environment, and returns whether the Node should, in fact, be scanned for dependencies\&. This check can be used to eliminate unnecessary calls to the scanner function when, for example, the underlying file represented by a Node does not yet exist\&.
.RE
.PP
recursive
.RS 4
An optional flag that specifies whether this scanner should be re\-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner\&. When this flag is not set, the Node subsystem will only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned, and not (for example) also on the files specified by the #include lines in the file being scanned\&.
\fIrecursive\fR
may be a callable function, in which case it will be called with a list of Nodes found and should return a list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be used to select a specific subset of Nodes for additional scanning\&.
.RE
.PP

.PP
SCons and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its implementation in Python\&. There are, however, a few portability issues waiting to trap the unwary\&.
.SS "\&.C file suffix"
.PP
SCons handles the upper\-case
\fB\&.C\fR
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.C\fR
suffix as a C++ source file\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.C\fR
suffix as a C source file\&.
.SS "\&.F file suffix"
.PP
SCons handles the upper\-case
\fB\&.F\fR
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.F\fR
suffix as a Fortran source file that is to be first run through the standard C preprocessor\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.F\fR
suffix as a Fortran source file that should
\fInot\fR
be run through the C preprocessor\&.
.SS "Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs\&. Windows Pythons"
.PP
Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a Windows system using a more POSIX\-like environment\&. The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX\-like path names\&. For example, the Cygwin tools will internally translate a Cygwin path name like
/cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname of
C:/mydir
(equivalent to
C:\emydir)\&.
.PP
Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as the python\&.org and ActiveState versions, do not have the Cygwin path name semantics\&. This means that using a native Windows version of Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as
\fBgcc\fR,
\fBbison\fR, and
\fBflex\fR) may yield unpredictable results\&. "Mixing and matching" in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to the use of path names in your SConscript files\&.
.PP
In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following rules: When using gcc, use the Cygwin\-supplied Python interpreter to run SCons; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++ (or some other Windows compiler) use the python\&.org or ActiveState version of Python to run SCons\&.
.SS "Windows: scons\&.bat file"
.PP
On Windows systems, SCons is executed via a wrapper
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
file\&. This has (at least) two ramifications:
.PP
First, Windows command\-line users that want to use variable assignment on the command line may have to put double quotes around the assignments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize this file as being the same as an
\fBscons\fR
command issued at the command\-line prompt\&. You can work around this either by executing
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
from the Cygwin command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named
\fBscons \&.\fR
.SS "MinGW"
.PP
The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or the PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons to detect and use the MinGW tools\&. When running under the native Windows Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin directories in the PATH variable\&. If you have both MSVC and MinGW installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must explicitly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tools=[\*(Aqmingw\*(Aq]

.if n \{\

to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools over the MinGW tools\&.

Specifying only \*(Aqa\*(Aq and \*(Aqb\*(Aq for the library names allows SCons to append the appropriate library prefix and suffix for the current platform (for example, \*(Aqliba\&.a\*(Aq on POSIX systems, \*(Aqa\&.lib\*(Aq on Windows)\&.

.SS "Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers"
.PP
Since windows\&.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take quite some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then include the previously compiled headers in any object file\&. This technology is called precompiled headers\&. The general recipe is to create a file named "StdAfx\&.cpp" that includes a single header named "StdAfx\&.h", and then include every header you want to precompile in "StdAfx\&.h", and finally include "StdAfx\&.h" as the first header in all the source files you are compiling to object files\&. For example:
.PP
StdAfx\&.h:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#include <windows\&.h>
#include <my_big_header\&.h>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.if n \{\

.nf
#include <StdAfx\&.h>
.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
Foo\&.cpp:

.SS "Using Microsoft Visual C++ external debugging information"

Since including debugging information in programs and shared libraries can cause their size to increase significantly, Microsoft provides a mechanism for including the debugging information in an external file called a PDB file\&. SCons supports PDB files through the PDB construction variable\&.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
In general,
scons
is not controlled by environment variables set in the shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the SConscript file author to import those if desired\&. However the following variables are imported by
scons
itself if set:
.PP
SCONS_LIB_DIR
.RS 4
Specifies the directory that contains the
scons
Python module directory (for example,
/home/aroach/scons\-src\-0\&.01/src/engine)\&.
.RE
.PP
SCONSFLAGS
.RS 4
A string of options that will be used by
scons
in addition to those passed on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG
.RS 4
(Windows only)\&. If set, save the shell environment variables generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (and/or Build Tools) to a file to give these settings, which are expensive to generate, persistence across
scons
invocations\&. Use of this option is primarily intended to aid performance in tightly controlled Continuous Integration setups\&.
.sp
If set to a True\-like value ("1",
"true"
or
"True") will cache to a file named
\&.scons_msvc_cache
in the user\*(Aqs home directory\&. If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the cache\&.
.sp
Note: use this cache with caution as it might be somewhat fragile: while each major toolset version (e\&.g\&. Visual Studio 2017 vs 2019) and architecture pair will get separate cache entries, if toolset updates cause a change to settings within a given release series,
scons
will not detect the change and will reuse old settings\&. Remove the cache file in case of problems with this\&.
scons
will ignore failures reading or writing the file and will silently revert to non\-cached behavior in such cases\&.
.sp
